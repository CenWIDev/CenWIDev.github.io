# Contributing

If you are looking to contribute to the site, file a new issue or work off of an existing entry. If you start work on the issue, leave a comment letting us know you've started work on it.

Fork the repository into your profile and start your work there. Currently there is no environment setup for the site, since it's just static content. Just clone your repository to your computer and open `index.html` in your web browser.

When you're completed, push your work up in a branch in your forked copy. Submit a pull request in this repository's master branch from the branch in your forked copy. We'll review it for code quality and content accuracy.

Once the code is approved and merged into master, the site is automatically deployed to [cenwidev.org](cenwidev.org).
